[This is a Link that goes to google](https://www.google.com "when u hover this shows") its typed by having the text to be clicked on wraped with square brackets and the address wrapped with normal brackets. Try to hover on it. The hover message is typed by quoting the hover message inside the normal brackets after the address. Hope that makes sense.
